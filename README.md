### Legacy Jint 0.9.2
- https://jint.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest
- as of commit 22024d8a6e7a, May 25, 2012
---

Jint has been rewritten completely and is now hosted on Github at http://github.com/sebastienros/jint.

 The main differences with the previous Jint you could find here are:
 - Javascript parser based on the Esprima project, providing better performance and strong support
 - Portable Class Library so you can use the library on any .NET platform
 - Based on the ECMA 262 test suite, comprised of more than 11500 unit tests to ensure every piece of the ECMA specification is respected

 And you still have the best performance you can get for real world scripts, string .NET interoperability, and a command line interface to run scripts from the command line.

 It's also available on nuget: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Jint

 You are strongly advised to convert your project to this new release, and open new bugs and feature requests on Github.
